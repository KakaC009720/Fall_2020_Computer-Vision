Description

Write a program to generate:
(a) a binary image (threshold at 128)
(b) a histogram
(c) connected components(regions with + at centroid, bounding box)

Announcement

．You may use any programming language of your choice to implement the functions required in assignment #2, provided that you do not use any library calls except for basic image IO (e.g. OpenCV).
．Binarize Lena with the threshold 128 (0-127,128-255).
．You have to draw the histogram. The part where you calculate the histogram must be done hardcored, but you may output your statistics data to a file and use auxiliary program to assist you in drawing the bar graphs, i.e., Excel, gnuplot, sigmaplot, matplotlib, matlab.
．For the connected components, please use 500 pixels as a threshold. Omit regions that have a pixel count less than 500.

．Grading policy
  Failing to provide a report will reduce your grade by 1~2 levels.
  Using restricted functions within your program (unless specified) will result in a failure of your work.

．Hint: You can use any programing language to implement homework. However don't just call libraries, if just call libraries you will get zero point.
