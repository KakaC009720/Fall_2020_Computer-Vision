Description

Write a program which does:
(a) Generate noisy images with gaussian noise(amplitude of 10 and 30)
(b) Generate noisy images with salt-and-pepper noise( probability 0.1 and 0.05)
(c) Use the 3x3, 5x5 box filter on images generated by (a)(b)
(d) Use 3x3, 5x5 median filter on images generated by (a)(b)
(e) Use both opening-then-closing and closing-then opening filter (using the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel, value = 0) on images generated by (a)(b)
You must calculate the signal-to-ratio (SNR) for each instance(4 noisy images and 24 processed images)

Announcement

．You must include your noisy image before processing and after processing in your report.
．You must calculate the signal-to-ratio (SNR) for each instance and write them in your report. Use this formula if any conflicts occur.
．You are to generate gaussian noise with amplitude of 10 and 30, salt-and-pepper noise with probability 0.1 and 0.05. You must use the 3x3, 5x5 box filter and median filter, both opening-then-closing and closing-then opening filter (using the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel, value = 0) on those images. You will produce 24 images and 4 noise figures.
．Here is a simple pseudo normal random number generator with mean 0 and variance 1. If your programming language provides an API for pseudo normal random numbers (i.e., randn in matlab, you may use it as an exception to hard code programming.
．You can use any programing language to implement homework, however, you'll get zero point if you just call existing library.
