Announcement

．You may use any programming language of your choice to implement the functions required in assignment #1, provided that you do not use any library calls except for basic image IO (e.g. OpenCV).
．For part 2, you can use any image processing software. In your report, you must specify which software you used to obtain the required results.

．Grading policy
  Failing to provide a report will reduce your grade by 1~2 levels.
  Using restricted functions within your program (unless specified) will result in a failure of your work.
  
．Hint: You can use any programing language to implement homework. However don't just call libraries, if just call libraries you will get zero point.
