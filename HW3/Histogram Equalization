Description

Write a program to generate images and histograms:
(a) original image and its histogram
(b) image with intensity divided by 3 and its histogram
(c) image after applying histogram equalization to (b) and its histogram

Announcement
．You may use any programming language of your choice to implement the functions required in assignment #3, provided that you do not use any library calls except for basic image IO (e.g. OpenCV).

．Grading policy
  Please include the histogram of the final image. (As in the previous assignment).
  You have to draw the histogram. The part where you calculate the histogram must be done hardcored, but you may output your statistics data to a file and use auxiliary program to assist you in drawing the bar graphs, i.e., Excel, gnuplot, sigmaplot, matplotlib, matlab.

．Hint: You can use any programing language to implement homework. However don't just call libraries, if just call libraries you will get zero point.
