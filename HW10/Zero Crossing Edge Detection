Description

．Implement 2 Laplacian Mask, Minimum Variance Laplacian, Laplacian of Gaussian, and Difference of Gaussian(inhibitory sigma=3, excitatory sigma=1, kernel size 11x11).
．Please list the kernels and the thresholds(for zero crossing) you used.
．Threshold Values listed below are for reference:
．(reference only)
(a) Laplace Mask1 (0, 1, 0, 1, -4, 1, 0, 1, 0): 15
(b) Laplace Mask2 (1, 1, 1, 1, -8, 1, 1, 1, 1)
(c) Minimum variance Laplacian: 20
(d) Laplace of Gaussian: 3000
(e) Difference of Gaussian: 1

Announcement

．You can use any programing language to implement homework, however, you'll get zero point if you just call existing library.
