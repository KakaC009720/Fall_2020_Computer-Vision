Description

Write programs which do gray-scale morphology on a gray-scale image(lena.bmp):
(a) Dilation
(b) Erosion
(c) Opening
(d) Closing

Announcement

．Please use the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel. (which is actually taking the local maxima or local minima respectively).
．4 images should be included in your report: Dilation, Erosion, Opening and Closing.
．You can use any programing language to implement homework, however, you'll get zero point if you just call existing library.
