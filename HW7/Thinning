Description

Write a program which does thinning on a downsampled image (lena.bmp).

Announcement

．Downsampling Lena from 512x512 to 64x64:
  Binarize the benchmark image lena as in HW2, then using 8x8 blocks as a unit, take the topmost-left pixel as the downsampled data.
．You have to use 4-connected neighborhood detection.
．You can use any programing language to implement homework, however, you'll get zero point if you just call existing library.
