Write programs which do binary morphology on a binary image:
(a) Dilation
(b) Erosion
(c) Opening
(d) Closing
(e) Hit-and-miss transform

Announcement
．Binarize Lena with the threshold 128 (0-127,128-255).
．Please use the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel.
．Please use the "L" shaped kernel (same as the text book) to detect the upper-right corner for hit-and-miss transform.
．Please process the white pixels (operating on white pixels).
．5 images should be included in your report: Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing, and Hit-and-Miss.
．You can use any programing language to implement homework, however, you'll get zero point if you just call existing library.
